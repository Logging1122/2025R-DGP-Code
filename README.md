RDGP-Code
## Overview

The code implements the proposed trajectory perturbation mechanisms under Local Differential Privacy (LDP), including multiple perturbation strategies and evaluation on four real-world datasets.

## Contents

- `Perturbation/`: Implementation of perturbation mechanisms(DGP,R-DGP,k-RR and Test_ATP). Each file can be directly run.
- `dataset/`: Contains four datasets used in our experiments (CHI, CLE, CPS, NYC).
- `deal_dataset.py`: Data preprocessing script.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- NumPy
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
